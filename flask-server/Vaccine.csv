@CBCNews I'm more interested in a survey on the broad idea of how common it is for people to feel lingering effects after the COVID-19 vaccine.
@eliehonig I mowed the lawn on day 2 with no vax. Most people had the same cold-like experience with covid pre-vax. Perhaps you should be angry that your vaccine didnt work as promised rather than thanking it for some mythical protection you imagine it gave you?
@TonyHinton2016 So let me get this right triple vaxxed and still caught covid and you think the vaccine works. Try looking at what you wrote again. You have clearly proven that the vaccine does not have any effect on stopping you from catching the virus.

"Taking the Dunbar number to be 100 (probably a bit low for our ancestors, and certainly low for us moderns) and the vaccinated population to be 200,000,000, then anecdotes should be roughly sensitive to a covid-19 vaccine ""IFR"" of 100/200 M = 0.00005%. Again, looking pretty safe!"
"I've said all along that if this thing were dangerous, however unethical the experiment may be, we have given it to O(100 M) people in the U.S. alone; death-by-vaccine would become anecdotally noticeable at that scale if it were a serious problem. I've never heard of 1 'round me."
